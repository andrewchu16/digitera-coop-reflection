      <h1 className="md:text-4xl text-2xl">Overall Experience</h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        My experience taking co-op has led me to learn what it's like to work in
        the computer science field and it has also led me to think more deeply
        on my career choice.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        Before taking co-op, I was already fully committed to doing computer
        science for life. I feel like computer science is practically the only
        pathway I can possibly succeed in or at least enjoy. I chose to do co-op
        so I could get a better idea of what my future would look like and to
        learn how to create large projects. In attending co-op I succeeded in
        these. I have made 6 websites since I started co-op. I've learned about
        database security. And, I've worked on a full project.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-3 text-slate-700">
        But, I could have learned pretty much all of these skills online. There
        is nothing special about learning them. I feel that the most important
        part of my co-op isn't the fact that I did it all, but rather how I felt
        doing it.
      </p>
      <h2 className="md:text-3xl text-xl mt-2">Programming is Frustrating</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        The truth is, computer science and programming are incredibly
        frustrating. All the time. There are often many problems to fix, reasons
        why your code just doesn't work. It can be very miserable at times. I
        have spent countless hours during my co-op, trying to chase elusive bugs
        and errors. Part of the issue was that I was learning a technology that
        I was not told to study during the summer. Ultimately, this struggle is
        almost inherent to the field: constantly solving unsolved problems.
      </p>
      <h2 className="md:text-3xl text-xl mt-2">
        Programming can be Interesting
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        This is not to say that computer science is without it's merits. The
        field of computer science fuels our digital world. I'm glad that I have
        this technological literacy and the ability to create my own computer
        applications. And, I'm proud of the work I did during my term and of the
        skills I've learned. I achieved my CELP goal of making a full computer
        application: As stated earlier, I made 6 websites this semester. I do
        enjoy certain aspects of programming.
      </p>
      <h2 className="md:text-3xl text-xl mt-2">
        How to Make Computer Science Enjoyable
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        There were multiple things I believe made my co-op experience more
        enjoyable. I found that working with another person made working a lot
        more enjoyable. It's nice to share the struggle with another person who
        understands the problems you are trying to solve.
      </p>
      <h2 className="md:text-3xl text-xl mt-2">Frontend Vs. Backend</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        There are basically two sides of programming an application: frontend
        and backend. Frontend developers work on coding the design and user
        experience. While, backend developers work on coding security and the
        database. As a fullstack developer, I could try both sides. I discovered
        that I struggle much more with coding the backend. I find the issues
        less rewarding to solve, and I simply lack the passion to work on it.
        For example, one of the tasks of the backend developer is to write
        hundreds of lines of convoluted security rules to protect the database.
        I find constructing the user experience to be much more interesting. It
        is easier to see problems and work out clever solutions. This preference
        for frontend is something that I will keep in mind for the future.
      </p>
      <h2 className="md:text-3xl text-xl mt-2">Programmer Vs. Designer</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        However, there is an adjacent career pathway that might be more suitable
        for me. Although I enjoy making apps, I think I would also enjoy the UI
        design process. As I stated earlier, I have an interest in creating user
        experiences and frontend. If I ever decide that programming is too
        frustrating for me, I have an alternate pathway I can choose.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
        My placement at Digitera has given me a more nuanced outlook on computer
        science. I have learned more about the struggles involved with computer
        science, my likes and dislikes, and whether I truly want to pursue it as
        my career. I am grateful for this opportunity. In the future, I may
        choose to become a UI/UX designer instead.
